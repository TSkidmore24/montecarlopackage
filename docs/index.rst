Welcome to montecarlo's documentation!
=========================================================

This montecarlo package was created for Quantum Software I (CHEM 3684). 

The purpose of this python package is to enable users to compute thermodynamic averages
using an Ising Hamiltonian. This Ising Model contains a graph, which consists of edges 
and vertices. Each vertice represents a spin of a particle, and each edge represents 
an interaction between the particles. Each edge has a corresponding weight. Using this 
model, the Ising Hamiltonian can be used to compute various thermodynamic averages 
including magnetization, energy, heat capacity and magnetic susceptibility.
